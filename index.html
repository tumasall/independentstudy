<h1> The Digital Divide and Islamophobia </h1>
<h2> Allison C. Tumas </h2>

<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p>The focus of this research is the digital divide and how it impacts Islam and reflects on Muslims, Arabs, Arab-Americans, and the Middle East and North Africa. This research delves into how the digital divide changes Americans&#8217; views on these particular groups and vice versa. The research focuses on the presence of these groups on social media and how it impacts their representation. Social media tools such as Twitter Counter and Google Trends were used to collect much of the information included in the research. This paper aims at distinguishing the aforementioned groups of people from one another while observing their trends in media and analyzing how it may generate increased Islamophobia from the West. </p>

<h3>The Digital Divide and Islamophobia</h3>
<p>There are many misconceptions that surround the topics of Islam and the Middle East, one being that these two words are exchangeable. Of the most prominent misconceptions there is the commonly shared idea that all Arabs are Muslims and all Muslim are Arabs. Another misconception is that only the Middle East practices Islam. Of the worst misconceptions, are the ideas that terrorism is representative of Islam and that religious terrorist groups are seeking religious control instead of simply seeking control and using religion as a means to an end. The topics surround this discussion as complex and difficult to understand without background knowledge in religious studies, Arabic language and world history. At the very basis it is important to distinguish the different terms that are commonly used interchangeably such as: Islam, The Middle East and North Africa, Arabs, and Muslims.</p>

<h4>Islam </h4>
<p>Islam is a monotheistic<sup>1</sup> religion that began in the the seventh century. Islam is centered around belief in the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. His revelations from the angel Gabriel are believed to comprise The Quran, which is the holy book of Islam. The Quran is written in Arabic and even in its translations the Arabic script must remain beside the translation. One of the most defining aspects of Islam are the Five Pillars of Islam which all Muslims are expected to adhere to. The Five Pillars of Islam are: </p>
<ol>
<li>	The belief in Allah (God) alone and that Prophet Muhammad is his messenger. </li>
<li>	Praying five times a day. </li>
<li>  Zakat: Similar to a <q>tithe</q> in that Muslims must give alms and share a percentage of their wealth. </li>
<li>	Ramadan: Fasting during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar each year. </li>
<li>	Making the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their life during the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, if they are physically and financially able to do so. </li>
</ol>

<h4> Muslims </h4>
<p>Muslims can be defined as those who believe is the doctrine of Islam. Muslims belief that Allah (God) is one<sup>2</sup> and he is eternal, creator, and sovereign. They believe in both angels and prophets. They also believe that Jesus was only a prophet and that Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was the last Prophet who brought the word of Allah through the Quran. Lastly, they believe in the last day of judgement and Heaven and Hell.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all Muslims are Arab, even though this is the common stereotype. Some of the largest populations of Muslims are found in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<h4>Arabs</h4>
<p>Arabs are classified as descendants of the Arabian Peninsula and its surrounding territories in the Middle East and North Africa. They are usually considered to speak Arabic as their first language. Not all Arabs are Muslims, in fact, roughly 14 million Arabs are Christian.</p>

<h4>The Middle East and North Africa</h4>
<p>The Middle East and North Africa is comprised of 22 countries that differ in their social, religious and political beliefs. For example, many are probably surprised to find that 40.5% of people in Lebanon identify as Christian, according to the Foreign Policy Journal. </p>

<p>These terms are important to define because once they are understood it becomes clear that are perceptions of Islam and the Muslim community are skewed. Many of these misconceptions stem from the idea that most Muslims speak Arabic in order to understand the Quran, this does not make them all Arab. It also sheds light on the idea that all Muslims are Arab. It is true that a majority of the Middle Eastern and North African population are Muslim, however that only makes up 20% of the Muslim community. Many of these stereotypes are perpetuated by the role of current media.</p>

<h3>Media and Islam</h3>
<p>The West controls a large portion of global media and the general public in the West has more access to information and the ability to publish that information. This arguably leads to misinformation due to unequal distribution of ideas and, specifically for the Muslim population, it leads to Islamophobia and a stereotyping of all Arabs to be considered as Muslim.</p>

<h4>Who controls the media?</h4>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum, the US controls a majority of the media content that is consumed worldwide. Even more shocking, six companies own roughly 90% of the media content that is assumed by Americans. These statistics show how almost all of the media that we consume is generated by six different companies. This suggests that there is little variety in our content and that are ability to obtain global perspectives is limited unless we actively seek out to do so.</p>

<h4>What does the media say about Islam?</h4>
<p>It is easy to understand the biases of the West found in media when looking at the topic of terrorist attacks and their coverage by news outlets. The first clue that there is an unequal representation is in the terminology used to described these events. It is no secret that terrorism occurs in every country and within each religion. However, because of Western media and perception the word <q>terrorism</q> resonates with most of the globe as Arabs and Muslims. It is also important to recognize that Western media will often refer to ISIS as an Islamic Terrorist group without emphasizing that they are Extremist Muslims and the majority of the Muslims do not agree with their practice of Islam, many exclaiming they are not Muslims at all.</p>
<p>On the same idea but an entirely different note, there is a massive difference in coverage over attacks on the West versus attacks that happen elsewhere. It is interesting that the same people we are led to fear (Muslims), also fear terrorism from Islamic Extremists. Much of the Western population does not understand this concept because the media often fails to cover attacks carried out on land that is not American or European. When the Paris attacks happened there was a worldwide uproar as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ignited fear into the West. However, days earlier there were terrorist attacks that took place in Lebanon and around that same time there were attacks carried out by extremist Islam terror groups in Mali and Burkina Faso.</p>

<h3>Islamophobia</h3>
<p>Islamophobia is defined as <q>A hatred or fear of Islam or Muslims, especially when feared as a political force.</q> Islamophobia has been increasing ever since the September 11th attacks and it continues to play a dominate role in our media today. On April 19, 2016, an article from ABC news made headlines when describing a situation where an Iraqi refugee was kicked off of an airline for speaking Arabic, specifically for uttering the word <q>inshallah</q> which translates to <q>If God wills it</q> and anyone with a basic knowledge of Arabic would know that it is used anytime someone refers to the future such as, <q>See you soon, inshallah.</q> </p>
<p>This is a prime example of how the misinformation about Islam leads to an increase in Islamophobia. The word that was so feared on that plane is often used by Christian Arabic speakers because the word carries heavy cultural context.  Interestingly, this word is not necessarily an indicator that a person identifies as Muslim and speaking Arabic or being Arab also is not an indicator. I am compelled to ask though, even if this man was correctly identified as a Muslim, is Islamophobia so strong in America that it is appropriate to be removed from an airline on that basis? </p>

<h4>Political History</h4>
<p>Terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda are always associated as Islamic terrorist groups and when analyzing their actions, it is almost always on the basis of religious beliefs. This is strange because most Muslims do not identify with the beliefs of these terrorist groups and go so far as to call them an abomination of Islam. So if they are not religious groups, what are they?</p>
<p>The Middle East and North Africa, which are associated with Islamic extremism, have a long and complex political and religious history. This history suggests that there terrorist groups are not simply religious groups, but that they are highly political with a desire for control. </p>
<p>For example, the book <q>Quicksand</q> by Geoffrey Wawro explains the long and complicated relationship between the Kingdom Saudi Arabia and America. The relationship begins with the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia and therefore, their overnight fortune that made them on of the richest countries in the world. This marked the beginning of America and Saudi Arabia becoming allies, and soon American ideals were consuming the historically traditional and poor Islamic country. </p>
<p>Regarding the 9/11 attacks, 17 of the 19 hijackers were identified as Saudi. Wawro explains the cultural and political factors that would lead to a group of traditional Muslim Saudi men to terrorize America. The culture in Saudi Arabia was rich in tradition and in history, it was centered around community, faith and family. The American culture that was consuming this culture is focused on individualism and efficiency, which is the polar opposite. Wawro explains how to government in Saudi and the rich, adopted these Western ideals while the poor continued to struggle for basic needs and slowly watched their culture be stripped away from their land. This was enough to cause resentment against the West by many of the traditional and poor Saudis that still make up a large portion of the country. </p>
<p>As if this cultural resentment was not enough, Wawro explains the deep tension that occurred and continues to occur upon America&#8217;s recognition of Israel. At the time, America needed the Jewish vote and therefore, not only recognized it as a state but also began funding military operations and providing military weapons to Israel. While all of the Middle East hated Israel and its occupation of Palestine, the West feared being labeled as Anti-Semetic. For these reasons, and many others, Wawro argues that the terrorist attacks were not necessarily religious but extremely political. </p>

<h3>Effects of Globalization on Muslims and Islam</h3>
<p>The aforementioned resistance to American culture but traditional and poor Saudi brings forth a problem that is widespread throughout the East and other developing countries. Many non-Western cultures resent America because of globalization, especially market globalization. Market globalization took place in both Lebanon and Saudi, in which the World Bank seized desirable property that was often turned into tourist locations for Westerners, and would only sell it back to the original owners for a price that was out of their price range and much higher than what they were given for the land.</p>
<p>While younger generations begin to adapt to the Western shopping centers and cinemas, the older and more traditional communities resent the West for taking their land and imposing a culture that is very opposite than the rich and traditional culture that the countries were built upon. This is an ongoing problem in underdeveloped countries and many are beginning to ask whether globalization is one-sided and synonymous with Westernization.</p>

<h3>Digital Divide</h3>
<p>The digital divide is a term that refers to the gap between demographics that can access modern information and communication technology and those that don&#8217;t have that ability. It can also refer to those that have limited access to these technologies or restricted internet access. There are five demographics that suffer most from the digital divide: </p>
<ol>
<li>	Those that live in rural areas </li>
<li>	Those with a native language other than English </li>
<li>	Those with low income and poor education </li>
<li>	The elderly </li>
<li>	The disabled </li>
</ol>

<p>This digital divide is critical to consider when evaluating media outlets and from where we are obtaining our information. The groups that suffer from the digital divide are usually underdeveloped country and not part of the West and European countries. This limited access to information limits what information they have to educate themselves with, as well as their ability to publish information that could educate others. This leads to little representation, which is often overlooked by Americans that have a culture that is consumed with creating public profiles and publishing opinions online. This is the main reason Islam is affected by the digital divide, because much of the middle east belong to these three demographics: </p>

<h4>Rural Areas </h4>
<p>A majority of the Middle East and North Africa are considered rural areas that have a communal focus instead of an individualistic society. These countries are often underdeveloped or developing and tend to have rich cultures and traditions that entirely oppose the values of the West. The economy is less focused on large businesses but instead focused on local trade of traditional craft, services and agriculture. While most people in these areas don&#8217;t have access to the Internet, a majority of them also follow into the category of uneducated and poor. In these areas, the idea of making a global impacting or creating change within their political system or economy seems like a fable, even if it is allowed. Publishing content for a larger audience to see is still restricted to governments and local newspapers. </p>

<h4> Low Income and Poor Education</h4>
<p>Other areas that are heavily affected by the digital divide are those areas where a majority of the population has a low income or poor education. These are often rural areas and developing countries such as many of the countries in the Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p>	There are still many of these countries that do not offer education for women, or it is not common practice to obtain an education as women. Women are another group that are heavily affected by this divide and not able to partake in the information exchanges that are available through modern technology. This not only contributes to less knowledge around the world but it also keeps their perspective less known and allows stereotypes and assumptions flourish around their way of life without giving them much of an opportunity to rebuttal. </p>
<p>	The topic of women is important because a stereotype of the Middle East is often that women are not allowed to be educated and that they are oppressed. Sometimes this is true, while other times it is not. Many times the women do not obtain an education simply because of the lack of resources for the entire community and because traditionally their culture places emphasis on family, meaning the women want to raise families and focus on that instead of working or going to college. This is common practice even in countries that do offer education for women, such as in Morocco. The stereotype of women being oppressed also has a rebuttal amongst many Muslim women from both the Middle East and other parts of the world. Many Muslim women find it liberating to be covered because they don&#8217;t feel they are dressing to impress men, their counterargument is that Western women could also be arguably oppressed in a different way. Lastly, in countries such as in the Gulf region, the common practices associated with oppressing women were part of the culture long before the introduction of Islam. Many argue that Islam is the leading factor in women gaining their rights in those areas.</p>
<p>My own research focuses on the amount of information that is distributed from the Middle East and how that information plays into the perception of Islam specifically in regards to Arabs and their relationship to Islamophobia. It is important to refer to earlier in this research when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its culture was influenced by an excess of wealth and Westernization. This created two groups in Saudi Arabia that can be detrimental to the perception of Islam, the rich that live Western lifestyles but need to maintain their religious for status and those who are poorer and live traditional lifestyles while watching Western ideals strip away their culture and take away many of the family and conservative values that are found in Islam. Both of these groups will claim Islam while their focus is much more political and cultural.</p>
<p>The more dangerous of these two groups are the rich that live Western lifestyle but promote Islam in order for status. This makes the religion a political tool instead of an actual faith known for peace and giving. This group is dangerous because they are of the few groups in Muslim populated areas that have access to Internet and modern communication technologies. This means that a majority of the media that we are receiving from the Middle East is, in fact, the perception of minority groups. For a more extreme example, refugees from Syria have had their homes stripped away and struggle for food while the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), are known to be technologically savvy and are extraordinarily skilled at producing media content that spews violence and creates fear around the topic of Islam.</p>
<p>Below are a few key concepts that I have gathered from researching the social media presence of the Middle East based off of tools like Google Trends and Twitter Counter:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>	While the majority of tweets from the Middle East around the topic of local media, the accounts that have the most followers are all religious accounts.</li>
<li>	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia dominates social media presence on Twitter along with Kuwait.</li>
<li>	The most popular accounts from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focus on Islam or wealthy lifestyles, two very different subjects that are often tweeted from the same accounts.</li>
<li>	Twitter accounts from Egypt focus on media and talk shows, Egypt is where the Middle East obtains most of their TV shows, music and movies. These are the accounts that have the most followers.</li>
<li>	The most followed accounts in Lebanon also focus on larger companies like telephone companies, fashion and famous singers.</li>
<li>	The top followed accounts in Morocco focus on internet companies and famous Moroccan singers.</li>
</ul>

<p>So from this information, is the social media presence on Twitter from the Middle East representative of the Middle East as a whole? The countries of Lebanon and Egypt are the countries with the highest Christian population and their viewpoints are not focused on Islam but instead focused on the same type of media that is popular in the West. However, the Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are heavily focused on religion and known to be very strict Sunni Muslims that are more supportive of extreme practices of Islam. From this information, one could assume that maybe Islam is extreme and represented well by media. However, it is non-negotiable that other Middle Eastern countries like Lebanon and Egypt are much less representative of what we see in Western news. For this reason, we must come to an agreement that the fear of Arabs in general is irrational.</p>
<p>We could stop there, but first we must analyze the last set of data presented which is the popular media accounts from Morocco. Morocco is in North Africa, it is also a predominately Sunni-Muslim population and it is governed under Islamic law. Morocco, however, is different from KSA and Kuwait because it is still a developing country and is a political ally of America. Given this information it is safe to consider that maybe the dominating Twitter presences of KSA and Kuwait are not representative of Islam because Moroccan media closely resembles Egypt, Lebanon and the West. The difference is that Morocco does not have the same access to internet and therefor there is less exposure.</p>
<p>The final point to keep in mind is that those are only five of the 22 countries that make up the Middle East and furthermore, those 22 countries only represent 20% of the Muslim population. And even in just those five accounts, the political, cultural and social views are extremely diverse. This is important in understanding the importance of access to modern information and communication technologies and how it&#8217;s unequal distribution can lead to misrepresentations of religious, cultural or ethnic groups.</p>

<h4>Native Arabic Speakers</h4>
	<p>This research paper will conclude with a personal narrative that highlights the effects of the digital divide between those who speak English as their first language and those who do not. It is clear that English is the business language of the world and also the language that most of Internet users are accustomed to using. Even the body language used on the most popular social media networking sites (i.e. the thumbs up for Facebook likes) are completely centered around the West and actually misrepresentative of the communication styles in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p>Personally, while conducting this research I stumbled upon a very accurate example of the struggle with the digital divide for those who are native Arabic speakers, and more importantly how this divide fueled to the idea of Islamophobia.  I saw a post with the hashtag &#1573;&#1610;&#1586;&#1610;&#1587;# and within the post were drawings of a romantic couple throughout each important stage of their life such as buying a new home, having their first child, etc. I read this without alarm as I knew the poster was referring to the Egyptian Goddess of the moon and motherhood. However, when I reached the comments I was shocked to see outrage from thousands of users with comments such as:</p>
	<q>Did anyone else notice that she tagged #ISIS in this post? Terrorist.</q>
and
	<q>#ISIS this is sick, to post this with drawings of families.</q>
	<p>At first I was completely bewildered as to what the commenters were referring to until I used the Facebook translation to translate the hashtag to English and saw the word that sparks Islamophobia and fear into so many Westerners, #ISIS. If you put an English accent on it I suppose the Goddess&#8217; name does sound like ISIS and would be spelled that way in English. However, in Arabic it sounds much different and is immediately recognizable as a name. In fact this word for ISIS in Arabic is actually pronounced da-ash and a completely different word than the American expression.</p>
	<p>This example serves to show how the digital divide places a barrier between the West and the East that can spark Islamophobia. If more people were educated about the Arabic language or if there were simply more Arabic speaking users with access to the Internet, the hateful comments would have been immediately refuted with an explanation. I was the first person to give that explanation, because I know both Arabic and English.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>This takeaway of this research is the importance of cultural education and receiving information from multiple credible sources. It is also a reminder to consider the digital divide when making assumptions on the world based off of media.  The Muslim Community and the Arab population, though two separate things, have dealt with the same struggle of misrepresentation in the media. They are often used interchangeably and considered to be one in the same which has brought misinformed stereotyping upon both groups.</p>
